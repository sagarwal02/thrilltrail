# ThrillTrail

My friends and I often struggle to find things to do in new cities (and sometimes even at home!). ThrillTrail searches thousands of posts to find the best spots, attractions, restaurants, bars, etc. you can visit in a new city :)

## Getting Started

First, make sure to install any dependcies.

```bash
npm install
# In retrieval/
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

The project uses the following external APIs:
- Reddit API (for post & comment retrieval)
- Google Maps API (get relevant address information)

Please create a local .env file that follows the format in "sample.env".

To run the project locally:
```bash
#In retrieval/
python3 -m flask run
#In root directory
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to start searching!

## Demo
